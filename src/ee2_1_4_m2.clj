;; Alternative implementation that addresses issues raised in
;; exercises 2.14, 2.15 and 2.16.
;; Every interval contains a unique identifier. There are two
;; cases to consider:
;;
;;  1) The interval with this identifier occurs for the first
;;     time in the expression. Then continue with bounded
;;     calculations.
;;  2) The interval with this identifier has already occurred
;;     in the expression. Discard the bounds, and continue
;;     with bounds of width zero.
